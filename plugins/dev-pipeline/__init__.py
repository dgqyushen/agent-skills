"""dev-pipeline plugin — create-gate policy hook.

Registers a ``pre_tool_call`` POLICY hook that vets ``skill_manage`` calls
containing ``create`` targets. A create is allowed only when the target skill
already exists under a real skill root of the ACTIVE profile — the exact roots
the runtime resolves skills against (``agent.skill_utils.get_all_skills_dirs()``:
active profile skills dir, ``skills.create_dir``, ``skills.external_dirs``) plus
this plugin's own bundled stage skills under their REGISTERED names
``dev-pipeline:<stage>`` (hermes_cli/plugins_content.py ``register_skill``) —
when the single-use allow flag at the RESOLVED flag path
(``_flag_path()`` = active home's ``skills/.allow-create``) is present —
one flag authorizes exactly ONE create, and the flag is unlinked BEFORE the
create passes (an unlink failure blocks with the flag left in place).

The existence oracle mirrors the runtime ``_find_skill``
(tools/skill_manager_tool.py) with ONE walker and ONE truth source: the bare
name matches where a ``SKILL.md`` whose enclosing directory name equals the
target name is found at ANY depth under a root (even without a ``category``,
e.g. ``root/team/existing/SKILL.md``) by a filtered recursive walk over the
same directories the runtime scanner yields — ``root.rglob("SKILL.md")``
filtered by ``agent.skill_utils.is_excluded_skill_path`` (excluded/dependency
dirs pruned, support dirs under a SKILL.md-bearing skill dir pruned, symlinked
directories NOT descended: pathlib ``rglob`` on the runtime's Python does not
recurse into them). There are NO direct ``root/<name>`` or
``root/<category>/<name>`` candidate checks: those bypassed the walker's
exclusion rule (an excluded-dir-nested create target — e.g. a ``category`` of
``node_modules`` — is rejected by the runtime scanner, and a symlinked
directory name is not followed, while the direct realpath checks answered
True for both). The runtime's FINAL lookup step is mirrored too: only when the directory-name
scan has failed across ALL roots does a skill whose ``SKILL.md`` frontmatter
``name:`` equals the target count as existing (the gate makes TWO passes —
every root's directory scan first, the frontmatter pass only after that whole
scan found nothing — the runtime consults frontmatter name matching only
after the directory scan, so a SKILL.md whose frontmatter cannot be parsed
never blocks a name the runtime resolves by directory name; directory-name
matches keep priority). Frontmatter claimants are deduped by the RESOLVED
SKILL.md FILE (realpath), the runtime's own dedupe key: two directories
symlinking one SKILL.md are ONE holder. More than one DISTINCT frontmatter
claimant is ambiguous — the runtime refuses to
guess and creates fresh, so the gate must gate it. The create-dedup check is
category-INDEPENDENT (runtime ``_create_skill`` calls ``_find_skill(name)``
with no category); the category argument is accepted but inert. Sibling
(INACTIVE) profiles are NOT existence roots — the runtime would create such a
name fresh in the active profile, so the gate must treat it too as a genuinely
new skill. Each configured root is itself checked against the runtime's
component-wise exclusion rule (``agent.skill_utils.is_excluded_skill_path``
over the ROOT's full path; mirrored full-path rule as fallback) BEFORE it is
scanned: a root whose own path carries an excluded component (e.g.
``/configured/node_modules/skills``) is skipped ENTIRELY — the runtime
scanner excludes every SKILL.md under such a root, so names "existing" only
there stay gated (the gate returning exists there would be a flag-free
bypass). And EACH DISCOVERED SKILL.md path is re-checked at FILE level by the
same runtime exclusion predicate before it may count as a claimant
(``_file_is_excluded`` → ``agent.skill_utils.is_excluded_skill_path`` on the
full path; mirrored full-path rule as fallback) — the AUTHORITATIVE filter:
the walker's directory-name pruning is an equivalent by-product, but it misses
a top-level ``SKILL.md`` that is a DIRECTORY (or a symlink to one), which
``os.walk`` files into ``dirnames`` instead of ``filenames`` — the walker then
descends into a ``references/`` tree under it that the runtime's rglob +
full-path check excludes entirely (round-6 fix #1: an external root like a
skill's own dir with ``references/nested/SKILL.md`` passed flag-free while
the runtime created 'nested' fresh). The root check remains as a cheap
pre-filter.

Runtime shapes covered (tools/skill_manager_tool.py: ``skill_manage``): the
flat shape ``{action: "create", name: ..., category: ...}`` and the atomic
batch shape ``{operations: [{action: "create", name: ...}, ...]}``, including
an ``operations`` value arriving as a JSON string (parsed and examined the
same way) and a DICT-valued ``operations`` (re-examined by the same recursion,
so the dict-structured and JSON-string-wrapped forms behave identically).
Every entry in a batch is examined; a benign first entry can never smuggle a
later new-skill create through. A batch with MORE THAN ONE well-formed entry
(creates plus any non-create mutating op — patch/edit/delete/write_file/
remove_file or any other entry shape) gets NO existence short-circuit at all:
every well-formed create goes to pending WITHOUT the pre-batch existence
lookup (round-6, Opus N1+N2). The runtime runs batch ops in order, so
pre-batch directory state cannot be trusted under such a batch: a mid-batch
delete can remove a pre-batch holder (the create then runs on a genuinely
fresh name), a mid-batch create can ADD a frontmatter claimant (making an
existing display name ambiguous, which the runtime resolves as not-found and
creates fresh), and a mid-batch patch can rewrite any of it. The runtime
outcome for an already-existing create target under such a batch is an
``already exists`` tool error and a full batch rollback — blocking those
(even with the flag) is the accepted over-gating; a genuinely fresh name is
gated as it must be. ONLY single-op calls (a flat create, or exactly one
well-formed create entry with no other op) keep the full runtime-parity
existence check — a create-only single-entry batch keeps frontmatter parity.
Recursion into a dict-shaped (or JSON-string-wrapped dict) ``operations``
ALWAYS carries the CALL's own flat create along with whatever the nested
dict yields — one payload must not lose a flat create it also carries.
FALSY ``operations`` values ('', 'null' after
parse, ' ', {}, 0, False, []) fall back to the flat fields, which stay GATED;
an unknown/unparseable shape gates the FLAT create instead of passing. This
is STRICTER than the skill_manage runtime, not a mirror of it: the runtime
routes anything that is ``not None`` to the batch path, which tool-errors
every non-non-empty-array shape — the gate would never let a flat create run
ungated if that truthiness ever differs, and a block of a payload the runtime
rejects anyway costs nothing, while a pass of one bypasses. Payloads the
runtime itself rejects pass through UNGATED only when they carry no flat
create to decide (the tool call fails there anyway).

Runtime contract (hermes_cli/plugins_dispatch.py, ``invoke_hook``): a
``pre_tool_call`` callback that RAISES or TIMES OUT fails CLOSED — the tool is
blocked with a policy error directive. This hook uses that deliberately:

- Non-``skill_manage`` calls return ``None`` immediately, before any code that
  can raise (fast pass path).
- On a create decision there is NO blanket try/except: an unexpected internal
  error propagates and the runtime turns it into a block. An undecided gate
  must not pass a create.

Accepted boundary (documented risk): this hook gates ONLY the ``skill_manage``
tool. The allow flag is an ordinary file the agent can write itself via
terminal/write_file, and skills can be created outside ``skill_manage`` with
the same file tools. Requiring the flag therefore makes the skill_manage path
ask for the user's consent but does not and cannot consent-lock the other
tools — user consent across terminal/write_file paths depends on those tools'
own policies and is the accepted, documented risk of this policy. The gate's
decision spans ONLY this call's payload: tool calls running in PARALLEL can
interleave mutations (another tool deleting or creating a skill) between the
gate's decision and this call's execution — that TOCTOU gap lies outside the
gate's serialization and is equally accepted (a decision is a snapshot of the
tree at decision time).

Category scoping (v0.1.7): the gate reserves NEW SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT skills
ONLY. A create whose ``category`` normalizes (strip + lowercase) to
``software-development`` is gated exactly as before — registered-name
pass-through, runtime-parity existence checks for single gated creates,
multi-entry batch gating over the gated creates, one-flag-one-create, the
file-level exclusion filter, the dangling-link check, and
consume-before-allow. EVERY OTHER create — any other category string, a
non-string category, or an absent/empty/whitespace category — is SKIPPED from
the decision pipeline exactly like registered-name creates: it contributes
nothing, never blocks (a malformed name on such a create is left to the
runtime's own validation), never counts toward the multi-entry rule, and
never consumes the allow flag. In a mixed batch (a gated create plus an
ungated one) only the gated create is decided; one flag still authorizes
exactly that one.

      only blocks something that failed anyway — and if the runtime's
