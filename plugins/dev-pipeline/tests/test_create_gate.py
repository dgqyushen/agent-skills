"""Full smoke matrix for the dev-pipeline pre_tool_call skill-create gate (v0.1.7).

Importable pytest module: every ``test_*`` function runs under
``pytest --import-mode=importlib`` AND via the direct runner
(``python3 tests/test_create_gate.py``), which collects the same functions.

Isolation: every case that writes anything runs inside a fixture HERMES_HOME
(temp dir honoring TMPDIR — NO ``dir=`` pin). The live ``~/.hermes/skills``
tree is READ-ONLY to this suite; the live ``.allow-create`` flag is never
renamed, moved, or consumed — live-root probing happens only when no live flag
exists at the RESOLVED flag path (and the probe SKIPS when one does), and
skips with a reason when the live skills tree is unreadable.

v0.1.2 matrix additions (round-3): active-profile-only existence scope
(cross-profile block), recursive directory-name find at any depth, registered
prefixed plugin-skill names vs gated bare stage names, operations as a JSON
string, empty-operations fallback to flat fields.

v0.1.3 matrix additions (round-4): walker-only existence oracle (direct
two-level candidate lookup DELETED — no excluded-dir-nesting bypass), runtime
frontmatter-name parity (unique holder exists; ambiguous holder gated), the
skipped-dir differential: a symlinked dir name resolves in NEITHER the gate
nor the runtime walker (neither follows dir symlinks), falsy/unknown
operations shapes still gate the flat create, the resolved flag path is
carried in the block message, a real Cyrillic homoglyph case asserts the
malformed-name token, and the direct runner exits cleanly on skips.

v0.1.4 matrix additions (round-5): a configured ROOT carrying an excluded
component is skipped ENTIRELY (names under it stay gated — runtime parity),
frontmatter claimants deduped by the RESOLVED SKILL.md file (two dirs
symlinking one SKILL.md = one holder), two-pass lookup sequence (a
frontmatter-reading failure cannot block a dir-name-matching create),
mutating batches disarm frontmatter-only existence, and dict-structured
operations never drop the CALL's own flat create.

v0.1.5 matrix additions (round-6): every DISCOVERED SKILL.md path is
re-checked at FILE level by the runtime exclusion predicate before it may
count as a claimant (a root whose top-level SKILL.md is a DIRECTORY escaped
the walker's filename-based has_skill_md pruning — os.walk files it into
dirnames — while the runtime's rglob + is_excluded_skill_path full-path check
excludes the support-dir tree under it: an external root like a skill's own
dir with references/nested/SKILL.md passed flag-free while the runtime
created 'nested' fresh), multi-entry batches (more than one well-formed
entry: several creates, or one create plus any mutating op) get NO existence
short-circuit at all — every well-formed create gated, an already-existing
name's runtime ``already exists`` rejection accepted as over-gating
(Opus N1: a mid-batch create can add a frontmatter claimant making an
existing display name ambiguous; Opus N2: [delete X, create X] recreates
fresh mid-batch) — while single-op calls keep the full runtime-parity
existence check, and a dict-operations payload whose nested level is
unparseable no longer emits the call's flat create twice (two identical
pendings would flip the multi-entry rule).

v0.1.7 matrix additions (round-8): the create-gate is SCOPED to the
software-development category — a create whose category normalizes
(strip + lower) to 'software-development' keeps every gated behavior
(existence parity, multi-entry batch gating, one-flag-one-create,
malformed-name block, flag consume-before-allow), while EVERY OTHER category
string (case/whitespace variants that do not normalize to it), any non-string
category, and an absent/empty category passes UNGATED: it contributes
nothing, never blocks (a malformed NAME on such a create is the runtime's
business, never a gate block), never counts toward the multi-entry rule, and
never consumes the flag. New cases: a non-dev category passes flag-free and
consumes nothing, a no-category create passes, a mixed batch (gated +
ungated) gates only the gated create (one flag still authorizes exactly it),
category normalization ('Software-Development ', 'SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT'),
the flag is NOT consumed on ungated passes, and the block message now says
the gate reserves new SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT skills.
