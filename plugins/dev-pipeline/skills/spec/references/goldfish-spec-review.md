# Goldfish spec review — pre-implementation stress test

Fresh-context, zero-history subagent review of a finished spec or plan,
before `test-evals` runs. Adapted from the Elephant-Goldfish Model (EGM,
Apache-2.0, created at Google); personas vendored at pinned commit
`3d0b348` — see `goldfish/ATTRIBUTION.md`.

## When to run

Complexity gate comes from `orchestrator/references/risk-routing.md`
(single home): the gate is offered at **S2 and S3**, right after the plan turn
is saved and the user has approved it, BEFORE `test-evals` runs. S0 and S1 are
exempt. So is research. Offer semantics: the stage makes ONE explicit offer
(the swarm's 4 dispatches, ~2–4 min each); dispatch only on the user's yes.
For plans of more than 3 tasks the offer carries a run recommendation
("recommended at this size"); for ≤3 tasks the offer recommends running it
too, and skipping needs the user's one-line ack recorded in the ledger. Never
dispatch the swarm without an explicit user yes for this build; a declined or
unanswered offer is noted in the ledger and execution continues.
- **Optional gate (spec range):** after the spec turn, before the plan turn,
  when intent risk is high — e.g. a wrong assumption here is expensive
  (new external integration, migration, public API). S2/S3 only. Skip by
  default.
- **Skip entirely for:** trivial single-task builds, research spikes, and
  anything where the user invoked review-commit directly on a diff.

Economy of scale rule: for plans of 3 tasks or fewer, ask the user before
dispatching the swarm.

## The default swarm (4 personas)

| Persona file (`references/goldfish/personas/`) | Role (one line) | Standard applied |
|---|---|---|
| `zoom_out.md` | Skeptical architect; kills over-engineering, dead-ends, speculative scope (YAGNI) | `standards/zoom-out-standard.md` |
| `comprehension.md` | Naive fresh reader; flags anything not self-contained or hand-waved | `standards/feature-spec-standard.md` |
| `design_critic.md` | Hostile senior critic; hidden risks, bottlenecks, unmitigated failure modes | `standards/feature-spec-standard.md` |
| `implementation_readiness.md` | Tech lead as implementer; flags plans not immediately actionable | `standards/implementation-readiness-standard.md` |

Off by default (enable only when the user asks):

- `structural.md`, `style.md` — layout and copy-editing. The controlled
  English style and the spec template already cover this locally.
- `codebase_details.md` — pedantic doc-vs-code audit. Only for rework of
  existing code, not greenfield.
- `synthesizer.md`, `bootstrap_orchestrator.md` — orchestrator synthesis is
  done by the pipeline stage itself; bootstrap is out of the trial scope.
- Upstream skills `egm_brainstorm` (overlaps `grill`), `egm_draft`
  (overlaps the spec turn), `egm_drift_report`, `egm_resolve`
  (converge loop covers findings) — not vendored; reconsider separately.

## Zero-context dispatch contract (Hermes `delegate_task`)

Each persona runs as ONE fresh, isolated subagent child. A goldfish review
with conversation history is not a goldfish review — never reuse a child.

Per child, pass ONLY:

1. The instruction to read its persona file first (absolute path) and the
   assigned standard file (absolute path), and to follow them verbatim.
2. The artifact under review: absolute path (spec or plan file under
   `.hermes/specs/` / `.hermes/plans/`).
3. An explicit read-only allow-list: files the persona may additionally read
   (e.g. live source dirs the plan touches, `.hermes/constitution.md`).
   Everything not listed is assumed unknown to it.
4. Its read-only protocol and severity labels: Blocker / Major / Nit, plus
   "Affected Scope" (file/line/section) and "Finding & Recommendation" per
   finding — the upstream output format.
5. Report destination: write its full report to
   `<artifact-dir>/goldfish/<persona-stem>.report.md` — artifact-first, no
   large findings dumped in the chat return. The child's text return states
   the report path plus a count per severity, nothing more.
6. If it lacks context it must report that as a finding, not guess.

Do not pass: project history, prior discussion, other personas' findings,
the user's expectations, or any review-model hints. Children answer nothing
from an allowed file they did not read.

## Convergence (runs in the stage, not in a child)

1. Read all four reports. Deduplicate overlapping findings.
2. Rank: Blockers first, then Majors, then Nits. Nits are listed, not
   discussed, unless the user asks.
3. Present the ranked list to the user; recommend accept/reject per Blocker
   and Major. The user owns acceptance — personas are advisory.
4. Approved fixes go into the spec/plan edits the stage already performs.
   No separate EGM resolve step.
5. Re-audit at most once: re-dispatch only personas that produced accepted
   Blocker/Major findings, on the changed ranges. Two rounds at most.
6. Proceed to `test-evals` with all remaining Nits attached to the plan
   as open review findings, if the user accepted them.

Model selection for the Goldfish children: the **Goldfish children** row in
`orchestrator/references/lanes.md` § Delegate pins (model, provider, and the
exact command). Every child runs on that pin, whatever model the dispatching
session runs. Mechanism: `delegate_task` children cannot pin a per-child
model (they inherit the parent's model), so dispatch each persona as a
one-shot child with the command from that row:

```
hermes chat -Q -m "$GOLDFISH_MODEL" --provider "$GOLDFISH_PROVIDER" --query-file <task-file>
```

`<task-file>` is `<artifact-dir>/goldfish/<persona-stem>.task.md` and holds
the full per-child instruction block from the contract above (persona file,
standard file, artifact path, allow-list, protocol, report destination) —
never on the command line. Zero-context rules, read-only protocol, and the
report destination are unchanged; a `-Q` one-shot child is as isolated as a
`delegate_task` child. They remain NOT reviewer lanes — their pin sits under
§ Delegate pins in `lanes.md`, not in the lane table, and never counts toward
a tier's reviewer set. Record the dispatch route (one-shot child, model that
ran) in the ledger.

## Trial envelope (bounded trial —MH policy)

- Started 2026-10-25. Exclusions above are load-bearing-path exclusions:
  the swarm is advisory-only and adds no new mutation steps.
- Review decision after the earlier of: 2 calendar weeks, or 3 non-trivial
  builds that used the gate. Criteria: did a Blocker/Major finding land
  before implementation in at least one build; was dispatch overhead
  acceptable; no persona prompt caused scope creep or question-asking.
- If kept: fold the trigger line into the spec stage SKILL.md flow table
  permanently and drop this trial note. If dropped: delete `goldfish/`
  and this file (ask before the deletion — MH policy).
